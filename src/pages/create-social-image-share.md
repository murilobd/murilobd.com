I have a motto in my mind that is "your code should work for you, not the opposite". Every time that I realize I've spent too much time doing something manual and for over and over times, I stressed out that it's time to automate and let my code do the job to me, so I can focus on other stuffs.

I've started this blog not a long ago and, every time I share the link, it's just a simple text the shared image. Not good and not cool. And, I really don't want to keep creating images over and over to every blog post. So, this is the perfect timing to "make my code works to me"!. How? Automating the creation of the social media share image for each blog post!

I've found this really [good tutorial](https://www.maxpou.fr/generate-social-image-share-with-gatsby) describing how to do it with Gatsby. Regarding the design/style of the image, my idea is to use [https://dev.to/](https://dev.to/) as reference and I really want to use [Hero Patterns](http://www.heropatterns.com/) as background.
