That's my new personal project: create a game creator using [Phaser](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser). **Goal:** allow my 11 years old nephew to create his games without asking me to code it.

This idea came up when I saw some of his drawings and said to him "Hey! Why don't you animate your characters and create a game with it? Let's do this?". Then, after time we ended up with this: [Patto, the game](https://patto-the-game.netlify.app/) - [Source code](https://github.com/murilobd/patto-the-game).

I could develop this project where I'm comfortable with, but I want to take this to a next step in terms of knowledge to me: I want to learn typescript properly and use Vue 3 (that's still in beta version while I'm writing this). If a back-end service is needed (and I think it will because of uploading/storing images), I'm willing to do it from scratch using Rust (but I'm also super tempted to use nodejs, as I've never done anything big/complex enough with it, or [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) - that's super ultra cool and probably would save me some good amount of hours coding).

So, in terms os technology stack, here's my plan:

-   Game framework: [Phaser](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser)
-   Front-end: Typescript + [Vue 3](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-next) + [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
-   Back-end: nodejs OR [Strapi](https://strapi.io) OR [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)

I'll be sharing all types of things that I see/learn/code here in the blog, but also in my [twitter account](https://twitter.com/murilobd). Hope you enjoy this journey as I'll do =D
